# cpabDiffeo
Finite-dimensional spaces of simple, fast, and highly-expressive diffeomorphisms, self-coined CPAB transformations, derived from parametric, continuously-defined, velocity fields.

This implementation is based on our [ICCV '15 paper](http://people.csail.mit.edu/freifeld/publications.htm)

Code is coming soon... 

We will make every effort to upload the code before the ICCV '15 conference (which will take place in Dec 13-16, 2015).
