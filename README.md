# cpabDiffeo
CPAB Transformations: finite-dimensional spaces of simple, fast, and highly-expressive diffeomorphisms derived from parametric, continuously-defined, velocity fields.

This implementation is mostly based on our ICCV '15 paper:
[Freifeld, Hauberg, Batmanghelich and Fisher III] 

Code is coming soon...
